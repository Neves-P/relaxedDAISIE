## Empirical Analysis

Individuals archipelagos can be analysed by calling the respective
*_model.sh file, for example:
```{bash}
Aldabra_Group_models.sh
```

All archipelago model can be run in parallel by running:
```{bash}
run_all_archipelago_models.sh
```

Once the models have been run the best maximum likelihood model can be extracted
from the replicates using:
``` r
find_max_loglik()
```
